 * Algorithm 1 (F5). Find the highest and lowest mark
 *
 */
1. Using the populated student marks array
2. Find the highest mark by looping through the student marks array
    2.1 Assign the first element (array_index = 0) in the marks array to the variable "highest" which will store the highest mark
    2.2 Compare the value in variable "highest" with all the elements in the array.
        2.2.1 FOR each element in the array (starting at "array_index" = 1 ) check to see if (marks[array_index] > highest). 
        2.2.2 IF (marks[array_index] > highest), we found a larger value therefore set (highest = marks[array_index]) 
        2.2.3 Increment array_index by 1
        2.2.4 REPEAT 2.2.2, 2.2.3 until you reach the end of the marks array.
        2.2.5 The current value stored in the variable "highest" is the highest mark.
    2.3 Display the highest mark
3. Find the lowest mark by looping through the student marks array
    3.1 Assign the first element (array_index = 0) in the marks array to the variable "lowest" which will store the lowest mark
    3.2 Compare the value in variable "lowest" with all the elements in the array.
        3.2.1 FOR each element in the array (starting at "array_index" = 1 ) check to see if (marks[array_index] < lowest). 
        3.2.2 IF (marks[array_index] < lowest), we found a smaller value therefore set (lowest = marks[array_index]) 
        3.2.3 Increment array_index by 1
        3.2.4 REPEAT 2.2.2, 2.2.3 until you reach the end of the marks array.
        3.2.5 The current value stored in the variable "lowest" is the lowest mark.
    3.3 Display the lowest mark

/*
 * Algorithm 2 (F6). Find the mean and standard deviation
 *
 */
1. Using the populated student marks array
2. Sum up all the student's marks
    2.1. Let sum = 0
    2.2. Loop through the marks array and add each element in the array to the sum
    2.3. End loop
3. Determine the total number of array elements and use it to calculate the mean
    3.1. Let the total number of elements = the array size i.e marks.length
    3.2. Let the mean = (sum from step 2) / (total number of elements)
    3.3. Display the mean
4. Find the standard deviation
    4.1 Using the value of the mean from step 3
    4.2 Let standard_deviation = 0.0
    4.3 FOR each mark in the array 
        4.3.1 Let sum += Math.pow(mark - mean, 2);
    4.4 END LOOP
    4.5 standard_deviation = Math.sqrt(sum / (marks.length - 1));
    4.6 Display standard deviation
