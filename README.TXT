USER INSTRUCTIONS:Pseudocode for algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 is provided in "Pseudocode.txt" and the Java program is provided in "StudentMark.java". The program fulfills the following functionality
    F1: Allow users to input the unit name
    F2: Allow users to input the students’ name and marks.
    F3: Report invalid input by showing an error message on the screen before allowing users to re-enter the mark. There are 25 students in the unit. A valid mark is any number between 0 and 100.
    F4: Print the unit name followed by the students’ marks after users have finished entering the marks.
    F5: Find the highest mark and the lowest mark and print the result on the screen (Algorithm 1)
    F6: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the marks and print the result on the screen (Algorithm 2)
